This is a replacement for
[Eric Fode's excellent `heroku-buildpack-rust`][fode], but with support for
recent Rust nightly builds.  For detailed instructions, please see
[Deploying Rust applications to Heroku][instructions], which explains how
to get everything working.

I plan to add support for the [Cargo alpha][cargo] shortly.
